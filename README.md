# Reptile-Interactive-Cursor
A single-file HTML5 &lt;canvas> animation that creates a reptile-like creature following your mouse. The body is made of connected segments using inverse kinematics, producing smooth, natural movement. Fully procedural with no images or libraries, it runs in real time and is easy to customize for fun cursor effects or creative coding projects.
